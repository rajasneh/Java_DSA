# Java Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

Welcome to the Java DSA repository! This repository contains a collection of Java implementations for various data structures and algorithms. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts, as well as a reference for Java developers.

## Overview

This repository includes implementations for a range of data structures and algorithms, including:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables
- **Algorithms**: Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort), Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search), Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, BFS, DFS)

Each implementation is designed to be easy to understand and modify, with clear comments and explanations.


### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor with Java support
